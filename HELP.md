## LG TV

> Before anything, you need to enable Network IP Control, which is very easy:

* Open the "All Settings" menu on the TV
* Using the remote arrows, navigate to "Connection". For some TVs, this may say "Network" instead.
* Quickly, press 82888 using the remote numeric buttons
* Note the MAC IP addresses for reference and library configuration
* Turn "Network IP Control" on
* Click "Generate Keycode", and take note of the 8 characters code displayed on the message for reference and library configuration. You can generate a new code at any time
* If you want to be able to turn the TV on, turn "Wake On LAN" on

**Available commands in this module**
